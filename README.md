This will eventually be the open source location for all of the information on how I built my Raspberry Pi CM4 Handheld device. I will have instructions on how to build the device and acquire all of the parts. All of the information will be posted once I finalize the design.

For now I have posted all of the photos that I have already posted on Reddit. And here is a list of youtube links for demoes on the device in operation:
